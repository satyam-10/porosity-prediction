Predicting porosity from well logs using machine learning is a common task in geology and reservoir engineering. Well logs provide valuable data about subsurface formations, and machine learning can be used to build predictive models.

After creating the model for the prediction of porosity , we will use Dockers to containerise our ML model

Containerization with Docker involves creating lightweight, portable, and isolated environments for running applications and services. Here are the steps to containerize an application using Docker:

1. **Install Docker**:
   - Before you start, ensure that Docker is installed on your system. Follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system, as mentioned in a previous response.

2. **Create a Dockerfile**:
   - Create a text file named `Dockerfile` (without an extension) in your project directory. This file defines how your container should be built. A simple Dockerfile structure looks like this:

   ```Dockerfile
   # Use a base image
   FROM base_image:tag

   # Set environment variables
   ENV key=value

   # Copy application files into the container
   COPY source destination

   # Expose ports (if needed)
   EXPOSE port

   # Define the startup command
   CMD ["command", "arg1", "arg2"]
   ```

   Customize the `Dockerfile` to match your application's requirements. Replace `base_image` with the base image you need, set environment variables, copy your application files, and define the command to run your application.

3. **Build the Docker Image**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the `Dockerfile`.
   - Run the following command to build the Docker image. Replace `<image_name>` with a name for your image and `<tag>` with a version or label (e.g., `latest`).

   ```bash
   docker build -t <image_name>:<tag> .
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   docker build -t myapp:1.0 .
   ```

   Docker will use the instructions in the `Dockerfile` to create a new image.

4. **Run a Docker Container**:
   - Once the image is built, you can run a container from it using the following command:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p host_port:container_port --name container_name image_name:tag
   ```

   - `-d`: Run the container in the background.
   - `-p`: Map a port on your host to a port in the container.
   - `--name`: Provide a name for your container.
   - `image_name:tag`: Specify the image to use.

   Example:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name myapp_container myapp:1.0
   ```

5. **Access the Container**:
   - You can access your application running in the container by visiting `http://localhost:8080` in a web browser (for the example above).

6. **Manage and Monitor Containers**:
   - To list all running containers: `docker ps`
   - To stop a container: `docker stop container_name`
   - To remove a container: `docker rm container_name`
   - To list all Docker images: `docker images`
   - To remove an image: `docker rmi image_name:tag`

These are the basic steps for containerizing your application using Docker. Customize the `Dockerfile` and Docker commands to suit your specific application and requirements. Docker provides extensive documentation and resources for more advanced use cases and Dockerfile instructions.

Now we will deploy the Docker container to a cloud platform , Following are the steps:

**Download the Google Cloud SDK, which you'll need to utilize Cloud Build to create our container.**

**The container is to the Container Registry of GCP.**

**Use Cloud Run to deploy it.**
